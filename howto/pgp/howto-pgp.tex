\subsection*{Somewhere secret, somewhere safe}
Your personal computer is always compromised! … or at least that's how you should treat it.

Two of the PGP keys that we'll create will be for signing docuements. That digital signature is
legally binding under many jurisdictions.

Someone can impersonate and sign documents as YOU if they have your signing keys!
Safeguard them well by NOT keeping them on an Internet connected computer!

Steps:
1. Acquire two (2) USB flash drives.
Note: The first drive is for the master signing and creating key. It also has a backup of all of your keys.
2. Mark the first drive with the letter ‘M’ or ‘masterkey’
3. Mark the second drive with the letter ‘S’ or ‘subkey’
\subsection*{Prepare the master key}
